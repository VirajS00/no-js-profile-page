# No js profile page

This was a fun little **"experiment"** I did where I tried to see how far I can go while creating a profile page **without JavaScript**.

I ended up taking **no JavaScript** very seriously ðŸ˜‚, that I did the backed also in another language **(Go)**.

This was a fun project, hope you enjoy it.
